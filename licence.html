              <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html"
                >GNU General Public License</a
              >
              (GNU GPL). I'm operating under the most current version of the
              license, which is v3 as of now.
            </p>

            <p>
              The GNU GPL is a copyleft license. It uses the framework of
              copyright to enforce that all users get free access to software
              (in this case, website source code).
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                "The GNU GPL does not restrict what people do in software; it
                just stops them from restricting others."

            <h2>What you can do</h2>
            <p>
              You can do... whatever you want! The GNU GPL allows you to use my
              code for any purpose, study it, modify it in whatever way that
              suits your needs, and redistribute or sell it (whether in its
              original or modified form). You don't need my permission to do
              this.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some examples of things that you can do:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Copy my entire website and upload it somewhere else (why you
                would want to do this is beyond me, but you can!)
              </li>
              <li>Modify my free code for personal use</li>
              <li>Modify my free code and redistribute it on your website</li>
              <li>Modify my free code and sell it</li>
              <li>Redistribute my free code as-is on your website</li>
              <li>Fork my code on Github</li>
              <li>Use a few lines of code in another project</li>
              <li>Use my code as a guide for your own</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Terms of use</h2>
            <p>
              I can't stop you from using my stuff on websites containing hate
              speech or other related bullshit, but be aware that I'm judging
              you, and I encourage anyone who sees my code being used for such
              purposes to judge as well.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides that: This isn't explicitly spelled out in the GNU GPL,
              but please don't claim my code as your "property" even if you're
              only using it privately. I'm using the GNU GPL specifically
              because I don't believe in intellectual property. If you're
              uncomfortable with your code being copied and want to ask people
              not to do so, I suggest you look elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you're using my code for private use, you're not under any
              obligation to publish your source code, but you should be okay
              with the fact that people are going to look at it and potentially
              use parts of it. Attribution is appreciated but optional. That
              being said, if someone asks you where you got your code, please
              direct them back here. I don't really care about recognition, but
              I do care about my resources being widely accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you redistribute my code, you need to give people the same
              freedoms that I'm giving you under the GNU GPL (including giving
              them a copy of the license text). You also need to tell people
              where they can get the original code. Again, this is for
              accessibility and not because I care about attribution.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you use a chunk of code that makes up a tiny piece of a bigger
              project, none of this applies because you're not really modifying
              "my" code anymore. Do whatever you want.
            </p>

            <h2>A bonus</h2>
            <p>
              If you're feeling so inclined, show me what you've done with my
              code! I would love to link to forks that people have made.
            </p>
