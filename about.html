              You see a small house engulfed by ivy on the far end of the
              street. You can't tell if it's abandoned; either way, you're
              pretty sure it's haunted. Insects buzz past your head as they
              enter and leave the overgrown vegetation in the yard, and you
              notice a concerning number of potted plants crowded against the
              windows.
            </p>

            <p>
              Against your better judgement, you approach the door. You prepare
              to knock, but the door creaks open on its own before you can.
              Yeah, this place is definitely haunted.

            <h2 id="website">This website</h2>
            <p>
              I originally futzed around with what I will loosely refer to as
              web development from about 2023-2024 because I thought I could
              make the next <a href="https://www.serebii.net/">Serebii</a>. my
              uncle had a web hosting service in his shop he made the
              ill-advised decision to let me use his web hosting(and ,
              eventually, my own domain) to accomplish this.
            </p>

            <p>
              Predictably, I did not make the next Serebii. After that, I had a
              few different blogging endeavors, but I ultimately fell off the
              train entirely around 2024 due to life stuff and there were rising
              new website everyday.

                    Your dominant hues are green and yellow. There's no doubt
                    about the fact that you think with your head, but you don't
                    want to be seen as boring and want people to know about your
                    adventurous streak now and again.

                    Your saturation level is higher than average - You know what
                    you want, but sometimes know not to tell everyone. You value
                    accomplishments and know you can get the job done, so don't
                    be afraid to run out and make things happen.

                      Haldane, who found himself in the company of a group of
                      theologians. On being asked what one could conclude as to
                      the nature of the Creator from a study of his creation,
                      Haldane is said to have answered, 'An inordinate fondness
                      for beetles.'"

                      You may be "common," but you're one in a million. Perhaps
                      you get overshadowed by your louder, brighter friends, but
                      everyone knows if they need a hand- whether it's moving or
                      trimming down the mold in their yards, you're the one to
                      call. Be bold, little roly-poly, and come out of your
                      shell. The world awaits.
